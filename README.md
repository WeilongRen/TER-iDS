Source codes and technical report for paper review, SIGMOD 2021

There are two folders, source_codes and Demo_programs. 
   For source_codes, it is composed of main.cpp and the available source codes of R*-tree. You can build the project using these two parts. 
   
   For Demo_programs, it is an execuable application. You can run this demo to see how our approach works.
